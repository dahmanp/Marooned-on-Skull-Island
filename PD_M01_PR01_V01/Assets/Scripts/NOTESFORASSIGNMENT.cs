//completed navmesh and adding nav agent to enemy prefab
//edited speedboost and slowdown pickups
//to-do: finish lesson
//       add stuff to poison and healthup

//why does the UnasssignedRefException error occur?


//idea: poison turns you purple and makes you slow, touching water reverses the effect?

// make all pickups into chests, keep different colored sparkles
